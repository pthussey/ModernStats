    "3. a) The population of interest is all births generally, and the sample is 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. b) The sample size is large which normally is an indicator that the results can be generalized to the population, however in different periods there are a lot of other potential confounding variables that could affect gestation periods other than just pollution levels. Also, the time and location constraints could affect generalizability. This is not an experiment so it cannot establigh a causal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. a) The population is all children between the ages of 5 and 15. b) The sample size is somewhat small which makes generalizabilty less reliable. The instruction and no instruction study has a treatment and control group so this could establish and causal relationship, but other variables do not so the results for those variables cannot be used to establish causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. a) The population seems to be all people generally. b) The sample is random and sufficiently large to generalize results to the population, however it could be a biased sample because they are all college students taking a statistics class. The study has treatment and control groups so it can establish causation.  \n",
    "Correction: a) The population of interest is all college students studying statistics b) the students were randomly assigned to groups, but not randomly selected so there are some generalization issues here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. a) The population is not explicitly stated but seems to be all people generally. b) The sample size is quite small to generalize to a large population, and it could be a biased sample because they are all Berkeley college students.\n",

    "11. a) At lower percentages of internet users there doesn't appear to be a relationship between percentage of internet users and life expectancy. However, at ages over 70, there does appear to be a positive relationship between percentage of internet users and life expectancy. b) observational, c) Percentage of internet users will be higher in countries that are generally more developed, so a potential confounding variable would be something like income level.  \n",
    "Correction: a) my answer is not wrong but a more specific answer is: positive, non-linear, somewhat strong\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. a) observational, b) no, c) When people are stressed they are working hard which requires either increased use of muscles in manual labor or long periods of sitting, both of which could be confounding variables which result in muscle cramps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. a) yes reasonable, b) yes reasonable, c) Not reasonable because there would be too few clusters so when clusters are selected large portions of the student body would be left out.  \n",
    "Correction: c) not a good approach because we want clusters that are diverse with respect to outcome, but in this case the students are close in age so they would likely have similar opinions.\n",

    "14. Random digit dialing will help ensure that a sample represents the population because picking only from the phone book would result in bias towards numbers that are listed.\n",
    "\n",

    "15. a) participants, b) The response variable is the participants reaction to the microwave oven, c) The explanatory variable is the dispositional attitude of the participants which seems to be a composite measure based on their feelings about a variety of different topics, d) It is randomly sampled, but from a single source: users of Amazon's Mechanical Turk. If participants were recruited from more diverse sources this could help reduce bias. e) there is no treatement and control group so this is an obervational study f) not an experiment so cannot establish causation g) it is random so yes it is generalizable but with some bias due to using an online tool for recruitment of participants\n",

    "16. Selecting students at an elementary school would eliminate the chance of selecting households that have no children and older children so this would be biased and would likely overestimate because of the lack of no children household results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. a) This is simple random sampling, and is a good choice to reduce bias. b) Limiting to just friends will introduce bias c) Same issue as in b but worse because the method uses a social media platform as the medium for the survey, d) This is multi-stage clustering and it would be a good choice to reduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. a) This is an observational study, not an experiment so we cannot conclude that smoking causes dementia. b) This could be a case of the reverse relationship actually being true: wherein children who have behavioural problems are in trouble more often and so they are not calm enough at night to sleep well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19. a) The response variable is exam performance, b) The explanatory variable is light levels which include: fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting, c) The blocking variable is whether or not someone wears glasses and it's levels are just yes or no.\n",

    "\n",
    "20. a) experiment because there was a treatment and control group, b) explanatory: type of pill taken and response: duration of cold symptoms, c) yes, d) yes e) yes, this would introduce a confounding variable because some of the participants would actually not have received any of the treatment.\n",

    "21. a) experiment, b) light: 3 levels (fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting) and noise: 3 levels (no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise), and also whether or not someone wears glasses. c) this is a blocking variable\n",

The treatments are no music, music that has no lyrics (instrumental), and music that has lyrics. Students will study for a set number of hours and then do a test on the subject matter studied.\n",

    "24. a) experiment b) treatment: exercise twice a week, control: no exercise c) No blocking d) no blinding e) Assuming a large enough random sample, the results can be generalized to the population. f) The main concern would be the definition of what \"exercise\" and \"no exercise\" mean. The type and intensity of exercise should be specified, and the no exercise group would need to be instructed on what constitutes no exercise.\n",

    "27. a) This would be biased because the parents that are most likely to fill out the form are the ones that are most easily available to the child after school. b) The sample group has changed so the results are no longer reliable. There could be some significant difference between those mothers that moved and those that didn't. c) The sample is biased because the only cases considered are ones that do not have any joint problems.\n",
    "\n",

    "28. a) explanatory: bachelors degree percentage, response: per capita income b) There is a positive relationship between the two variables, c) we can say there is correlation, but we cannot infer causality from these observations\n",

    "\n",
    "29. a) experiment, b) explanatory: type of vegetable / fruit intervention, response: psychological well-being c) The students were volunteer students from one university so the sample is not sufficiently random to generalize to the population d) There is the sampling problem so I would say no the causal relationship cannot be established. e) Due to the voluntary nature of the sampling and limited population, I would say that the article should state that the results of this study show that this study showed evidence for psychological benefits within the population studied.  \n",
