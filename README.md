The Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS) book is an excellent free resource for anyone interested in learning statistical exploratory data analysis using modern techniques. In the case of this book the programming language used is R. I however am accustomed to using Python so when going through the lesssons in this book I use Python to recreate the analysis and visualizations in each chapter. I've found this to be really good practice for my programming skills and at the same time I can learn more about the statistical methods introduced in the book.

The datasets used in the book can be found here: https://www.openintro.org/data/
