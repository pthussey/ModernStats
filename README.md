# ModernStats
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I made and the datasets I used when studying the online book 'Introduction to Modern Statistics'.

My study of this book is still ongoing.

The Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS) book is an excellent free resource for anyone interested in learning statistical exploratory data analysis using modern techniques (ie. programming). In the case of this book the programming language used is R. However, I'm accustomed to using Python, so when going through the lesssons in this book, in addition to completing the exercise questions, I also use Python to recreate the analysis and visualizations in each chapter. I've found this to be really good practice for my programming skills and at the same time I can learn more about the analytical methods introduced in the book.

The datasets used in the book can be found here: https://www.openintro.org/data/
