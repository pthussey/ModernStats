# ModernStats
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I made, and the datasets I used, when studying the online book 'Introduction to Modern Statistics'.  
Online book URL: https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/  
The datasets used in the book can be found here: https://www.openintro.org/data/

My study of this book is still ongoing.

The Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS) book is an excellent free resource for anyone interested in learning statistical exploratory data analysis using modern techniques (ie. programming). In the case of this book the programming language used is R. However, I'm accustomed to using Python, so when going through the lesssons in this book, in addition to completing the exercise questions, I also use Python to recreate the analysis and visualizations in each chapter. I've found this to be really good practice for my programming skills and at the same time I can learn more about the analytical methods introduced in the book.

To recreate the environment I used while going through this book you will need to have Python 3.10 and Jupyter installed. The requirements file can be used to install the Python package I used with the same versions. And, finally you will need to download the data analysis package I built called [DataStats](https://github.com/pthussey/DataStats) which can be installed using the command below:  
pip install git+https://github.com/pthussey/DataStats
